# Refactor

Apply systematic refactoring with test-driven discipline.

## Instructions

When the user invokes this command:

1. **Identify the target** — Ask what code to refactor if not specified
2. **Assess** — Is this actually refactoring? (Not a bug fix, feature, or formatting)
3. **Protect** — Verify test coverage exists, or add characterization tests first
4. **Refactor** — ONE change at a time, smallest scope first
5. **Verify** — Run tests after each change, commit on green, revert on red
6. **Iterate** — Repeat until complete, then run `/audit`

**Iron Law:** ONE REFACTORING → TEST → COMMIT. Never batch changes.
